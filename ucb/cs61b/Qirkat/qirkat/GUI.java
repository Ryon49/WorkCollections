class GUI extends TopLevel implements Observer, Reporter {

    /* The implementation strategy applied here is to make it as
     * unnecessary as possible for the rest of the program to know that it
     * is interacting with a GUI as opposed to a terminal.
     *
     * To this end, we first have made Board observable, so that the
     * GUI gets notified of changes to a Game's board and can interrogate
     * it as needed, while the Game and Board themselves need not be aware
     * that it is being watched.
     *
     * Second, instead of creating a new API by which the GUI communicates
     * with a Game, we instead simply arrange to make the GUI's input look
     * like that from a terminal, so that we can reuse all the machinery
     * in the rest of the program to interpret and execute commands.  The
     * GUI simply composes commands (such as "start" or "clear") and
     * writes them to a Writer that (using the Java library's PipedReader
     * and PipedWriter classes) provides input to the Game using exactly the
     * same API as would be used to read from a terminal. Thus, a simple
     * Manual player can handle all commands and moves from the GUI.
     *
     * See also Main.java for how this might get set up.
